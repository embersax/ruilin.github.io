## About 
I'm a first year PhD student at Computer Science Enginering Department of University of California,Santa Cruz. My interest lies in Computer Network with a focus on quantum network. I'm also intersted in quantum computing and quantum cryptography. My advisor is Prof Chen Qian.

I received my Bachelor's degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT) in Applied Physics and my Master dergee in Science from Northwestern University(NU) in Electrical Engineering.

My previous research mainly focuses on quantum annealing in which we used quantom annealing to solve graph isomorphic problems.
